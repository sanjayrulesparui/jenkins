Jenkins overview:

- Navigate to https://mule-jenkins.hologic.com/ and login using AD credentials to access server

Home page:

- Central portion of page displays list of existing builds, can be organized using tabs
- List of items on left portion of screen includes jenkins build & configuration options, queued builds, and builds currently being executed

Configuring new build for Mule project:

1. Select 'New Item' in top-left corner of page
	- Enter name for project
	- Search for & select 'generic-pipeline' in 'copy from' input bar towards bottom of page
	- click OK -> Jenkins will redirect to configuration page for newly created build
2. Modify configuration page
	- Change project description
	- Modify pipeline script definition input parameters
		- githubOrg: name of organization in which Mule project is stored in
		- repoName: name of github repository that Mule project is stored in
		- repoBranch: desired branch within repo to build project from
		- repoPath: relative path within repository in which project is located
			- Ex: apps/project1
	- Click 'save' -> Jenkins will redirect to project page
3. In top right portion of newly created project page, click 'enable project' button
	- Jenkins will begin polling github for project changes, and initiate a build when detected
	
Execute Build:

A build will initiate on detection of change within specified location within github. (The time interval
for detection is set in the pipeline cron config.)
Once a build begins a flashing dot is displayed next to the pipeline name. Users can also manually 
initiate a build by selecting the 'build now' button on the pipeline page. 
Once a build begins, the pipeline will initialize and run until reaching the dev environment.
(The pom.xml for the project must be set to auto-deploy=true.)
Human intervention is required to chose whether or not to deploy at that step of the build. 
The build will continue to prompt through tst, uat, and production steps until the project lifecycle is complete.

If a new build is intiated, any build that is running must be aborted before the new build will start. Only
one build runs at any given time for this pipeline.
